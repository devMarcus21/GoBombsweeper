# GoBombsweeper

## About

This is a fun personal project I decided to do to learn Go

I think Go is a very cool and unique language unlike anything else out there and I would like to learn about it more

As a Go noob, I thought it would be a good idea to implement GoBombsweeper as a trivial starter project which I can easily scale the complexity of

## Features

- I want to be able to create and play an instance of the game
- Unit tests will be an important part of this project

### maybe (probably not)

- Log in to my account and access all my games I started
- Access a history of all my games
- View a move history for each game
- Host this as a service on a cloud provider (more than likely not)

## Iterations

I will be dividing this project into 3 main iterations

### crawl

Build basic components that can provide the base of logic of the game that are well tested

### walk

Combine those components together into a very simple monilithic API and backend

### run

Build a simple web UI in order to play a game
